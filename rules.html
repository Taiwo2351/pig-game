        <p> The rules of the Game goes thus </p>
        <p> Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
          <p><img src="images/dice-1.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail"> If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
        <p>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p> The first player to score 50 or more points wins. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p> For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score. </p>
